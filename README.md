Texas Hold'em poker in Golang

This is my first project in Golang

You can play multiplayer on a single computer or play against bots

To play, comment or uncomment the main function in main.go
func main() {
	poker() // this is the mode to play mutiplayer or single player
	//botMode() // this is the bot mode to see andre playing vs gomez, this mode has been created to improve the IA
}
