Texas Hold'em poker in Golang

This is my first project in Golang

You can play multiplayer on a single computer or play against bots: (only 1 bot for the moment)

To play, change the main function in main.go
func main() {
	poker() // this is the mode to play mutiplayer or single player
	//botMode() // this is the bot mode to see andre playing vs gomez
}

--> go run main.go cards.go game.go bot.go player.go odds.go math_functions.go


I am working on an AI player to play against
